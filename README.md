# Nebulo

## Overview

Nebulo is a fuzzy logic framework derived from the concept of "Nebula," symbolizing the vast potential and complexity of fuzzy systems. Just as a nebula is a cloud of gas and dust in space, Nebulo provides a flexible and powerful environment for modeling uncertainty and imprecision in various applications. This project aims to simplify the implementation of fuzzy logic systems, making it accessible for developers and researchers alike.

## Features

- **Fuzzy Variables**: Define and manage fuzzy variables with associated membership functions.
- **Membership Functions**: Utilize various types of membership functions, including triangular, trapezoidal, and Gaussian.
- **Fuzzy Rules**: Create and evaluate fuzzy rules using both Sugeno and Mamdani approaches.
- **Fuzzy Systems**: Build comprehensive fuzzy systems that can process inputs and provide outputs based on defined rules.
- **Utilities**: Access utility functions for common tasks, such as computing trends.

## Installation

To install Nebulo, clone the repository and install the required dependencies:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Vladutul/Nebulo.git
cd Nebulo
pip install -e .
```

## Usage

Refer to the `examples/examples.py` file for practical examples of how to use the Nebulo framework. You can define fuzzy variables, create fuzzy systems, and evaluate them based on your specific needs.
